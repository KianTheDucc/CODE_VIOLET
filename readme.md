### CODE VIOLET ### 

CODE VIOLET is a cyberpunk metroidvania set in a hyper-futuristic version of Earth.
The player plays as a soldier sent on a mission to protect the city, dealing with a raid in a specific building.

The city is under attack.

They are attacking and disrupting our utopia.

Your job is to remove the resistance.

Your job is to eliminate.

Your job is to listen and do.

Keep your visor on, itâ€™s a CODE VIOLET!
